Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. 

Previously-
After years of working unfulfilling jobs I decided on a career change. 
I attended Code Fellows For software developing focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and Android app development.

Currently-
I am taking more online classes through Udemy to further expand my knowledge base.
I am also working on two android apps. Mostly for the purpose of keeping what I learned at Code Fellows fresh, but also to continue my learning.

If you are here because you are interested in my possible employment-
I am looking for a Position where I can contribute, and constantly keep learning by working with a team of professionals.
Please contact me at Chuckalto@gmail.com if you have any questions. I welcome all inquiries.

If you are looking to collaborate-
I love working as part of a team and am open to collaborate on all different types of projects. from Commercial to non-profit. Even if it just to practice working as a team and sharpening our skills.
